jQuery
''''''

The library of jQuery can included in the footer of the HTML page in every case.
There isn't any need, to include it at the top any longer.


Templates
'''''''''

There are two new TypoScript templates:

* Slick [01.2.1] +Image without figure (slick)

* Slick [99.1.1] +Dev: static JavaScript

The first one removes the figure wrap and the figure caption from the HTML image code.
It is recommended to use this template!

The second one is for development. It includes a JavaScript code independent 
of the properties of any slick plugin. See: :ref:`Developers > Debugging <developers_debugging>`
