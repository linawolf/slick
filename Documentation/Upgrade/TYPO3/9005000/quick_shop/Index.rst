EXT:quick_shop (Quick Shop)
===========================

Probably your slider with Quick Shop items (generated by the EXT:browser) isn't running any longer.

In this case, you must replace this slider by the xBlog-Slider (EXT:xblog).


Installation
------------

* Install xBlog (EXT:xblog)

* Include the static templates:

	* xBlog [0.1.0] Base

	* xBlog [1.0.0] Main

	* xBlog [7.0.0] +Slider


Create a folder for the xBlog Slider
------------------------------------

* Create a page

		* Call it xBlogSlider

		* Set the type to [folder]

* Insert the plugin [xBlog +Slider] 

	* Call it: xBlogSlider

	* Tab [Plugin]

		* Tab [Table]

			* Field: Table = [Quick Shop: Item]

			* Field: Order field = [price (Groos price)]

			* Field: Order direction = [descending]

			* Field: Items per xBlog page = [12]

			* Field: Record Storage Page = [Folder with your Quick Shop items]

		* Tab [Bridge]

			* Field: Images = [image (Images)]

	* [Save it!]


Replace the former slider
-------------------------

* Select the page with the former slider in the page tree (often it is called "shop")

* Insert the plugin [Slick Slider with Content Elements]

	* Call it: Slider for Quick Shop Items

	* Tab [Slick Items]

		* Field: Records

			* Klick [Page Content] 
			
			* Insert the xBlogSlider plugin from above

	* [Save it!]

* Disable the former slider, which was generated by the EXT:browser

Enjoy the result in the frontend.
